# LED Matrix Visualizer

Check out the demo [here](https://daniellok.github.io/led-matrix-visualizer/)

This is a small interactive tool I made to visualize an LED matrix. I was experimenting with different designs for an LED display, and wanted a quick and easy way to prototype. Hopefully you can get some use out of it as well!

To use, just drag your mouse over the bulbs to light them up.
